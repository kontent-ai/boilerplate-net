## How to's


### How to change Kentico Cloud Project ID and Delivery Preview API key

Kentico Cloud Project ID is stored inside `appsettings.json` file. This setting is automatically loaded [using Options and configuration objects](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration). You can also provide additional environment-specific configuration in `appsettings.production.json` and `appsettings.development.json` files.

For security reasons, Delivery Preview API key should be stored outside of the project tree. It's recommended to use [Secret Manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets) to store sensitive data.

### How to generate Strongly Typed Models for Content Types

Content Type Models are generated by [models generator utility](https://github.com/Kentico/cloud-generators-net). By convention, all Content Type Models are stored within the `Models/ContentTypes` folder. All generated classes are marked as [`partial`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/wa80x488.aspx) which means that they can be extended in separate files. This should prevent losing custom code in case the models get regenerated.


### How to set up fixed-time caching


### How to handle 404 errors or any other error

Error handling is setup by default. Any server exception or error response within 400-600 status code range is handled by ErrorController. By default, it's configured to display Not Found error page for 404 error and General Error for anything else. 


### How to handle 301 Permanent redirect


The Boilerplate is configured to load all [URL Rewriting](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/url-rewriting) rules from [IISUrlRewrite.xml](/src/CloudBoilerplateNet/IISUrlRewrite.xml) file. Add or modify existing rules to match your expected behavior.

:warning: ASP.NET Core 1.1 currently [doesn't support Rewrite Maps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/url-rewriting#unsupported-features), but there is a simple workaround for `/oldUrl -> /newUrl` mapping (see [IISUrlRewrite.xml](/src/CloudBoilerplateNet/IISUrlRewrite.xml) for example).
